My first Repository!!!

My name is Jamie Burrows. I am 24 years old and i am studying Software Development at Computer Power Plus in Christchurch, NZ. I have been studying for about 10 months and am around 2 months away from gaining my diploma (L5) before continuing and gaining my diploma in Advanced Software Development (L6). Some of my interests are computers, gaming, reading, music and just enjoying life as much as possible.
I hope to continue to a career in software development after graduating and cant wait!
